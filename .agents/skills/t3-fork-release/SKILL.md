description: Release ready personal T3 features together with upstream updates, or resume/report their all-host deployment and safe cleanup. Use for merge and build, merge and publish, release everything ready, and release status.

# Release ready features

Read [the operations guide](../../../docs/operations/personal-fork.md). An explicit
release request authorizes normal publication, all-inventory staging and guarded
cleanup of included features. Feature completion alone does not authorize release.
Never create PRs or force-update `dev`/`main`. Missing hosts remain required.

Use canonical shared state (`manage.py paths`), not a worktree-local controller.
Keep this thread rooted; merges happen in the coordinator's candidate worktree.
Acquire `manage.py lock-run` in a persistent tty, hold stdin open through integration
and publication, and release by EOF. Read `manage.py status`, existing release JSON
and any deployment journal first. Run `workflow.py finalize` to finish eligible
cleanup from prior releases and report retained work. An incomplete cutover needs
recovery, not a new release. Use the coordinator from the latest canonical source; do not trust an old
worktree's skill or script over newer published instructions.

## Freeze, integrate and check

```sh
python3 scripts/personal-fork/workflow.py list
python3 scripts/personal-fork/workflow.py freeze RELEASE_ID
python3 scripts/personal-fork/workflow.py integrate RELEASE_ID
```

Use a unique lowercase release ID. `list` fetches cross-machine ready markers,
checks exact branch heads and source activity, and reports exclusions. Unregistered,
dirty, active or stale features do not enter the batch. If a source is unreachable,
report its excluded features; never infer readiness from a branch name or chat title.
`freeze` pins personal, upstream and ready dependency order. New ready work waits
for the next release. Inspect exclusions and unresolved decisions before proceeding;
never silently choose product semantics or omit a requested dependency.

`integrate` creates/resumes a sibling candidate and ordinary merges. On conflict,
inspect the preserved candidate, resolve mechanical conflicts, commit and resume.
Follow [t3-fork-upstream](../t3-fork-upstream/SKILL.md) for EVERY `FORK.md` behavior,
including clean merges. Compare features with one another too. Queue ambiguous
product choices in canonical decisions.md and preserve the candidate.

Run candidate instructions, manifest checks, focused interaction tests and
`vp run check:changed FORK_SHA`. Perform the required integrated client pass.
Record real commands/results, not a generic claim that checks passed. Then:

```sh
python3 scripts/personal-fork/workflow.py verify RELEASE_ID --checks "Commands and actual results"
python3 scripts/personal-fork/workflow.py publish RELEASE_ID
python3 scripts/personal-fork/workflow.py stage RELEASE_ID
python3 scripts/personal-fork/workflow.py report RELEASE_ID
```

`publish` rejects a changed candidate or a concurrent personal advance. Merge new
personal into the candidate, inspect interactions and reverify; never overwrite it.
`stage` builds the exact published commit everywhere. An ancestor pending revision
can be superseded under the release lock before cutover; divergent queues or any
cutover journal block it. Failed builds preserve the prior queue/installations.
Release the integration lock and end the turn after staging; the independent
worker owns shutdown, stopped-state backups, cutover and health checks.

## Resume, clean and report

For a status/resume request, read the existing release record and live status;
do not freeze another batch or repeat already successful checks without cause.
After ALL inventory hosts run the exact commit, run `workflow.py cleanup RELEASE_ID`
and `workflow.py report RELEASE_ID`. It never deletes unrelated/unincluded branches,
advanced/dirty workspaces or a workspace still owned by T3. Runtime/process ownership
that cannot be proved safe defers deletion. Use T3's existing Storage cleanup to
retire chat-owned workspaces; do not write live SQLite or remove directories behind
resumable threads. Remote cleanup runs on the source machine after inspection.
Conditional ref deletion uses an expected SHA; this is not permission to rewrite
branch history. Preserve readiness/release records so included commits stay traceable.

Report user-visible features, upstream range/highlights, checks/limits, exact source
SHA, per-host staged/pending/verified state, removed branches/worktrees and every
retained item with its reason. Link the generated Markdown report. A staged build
is not an installed release. Do not restart the host to finish your own task.
