# Tom's T3 Code

This fork imports the customizations from `ralfboltshauser/t3code:personal`
(commit `32f97584a7262856e18b7b0de4de49525bd88ece`) with their Git history.
The integration branch is `dev`; `main` remains an upstream mirror.

The root of this repository is the product fork. Integrate personal features and
maintain its skills/tooling on `dev`; develop independent features in worktrees. `main` follows `pingdotgg/t3code:main`
without personal commits; connect upstream history through ordinary merges.

Fetch `origin dev` and inspect status/history before starting work. Preserve
unfinished files and local commits; use a sibling worktree from the latest
`origin/dev` for independent work. Keep the canonical checkout on `dev`
so the maintenance worker's scripts remain available. Read upstream files with
Git or a worktree instead of switching the canonical checkout to `main`.

Use `.agents/skills/t3-fork-feature/SKILL.md` for feature work and
`.agents/skills/t3-fork-upstream/SKILL.md` for upstream integration.

Feature work follows `t3-fork-feature` and ends ready on a pushed feature branch.
Only an explicit `t3-fork-release` / "merge and build" request gathers ready
features plus upstream and stages a release. Side chats share their parent's
feature. Daily maintenance inspects upstream without publishing.

## Intentional differences

New independent threads default to worktrees based on fetched `dev` through
`t3.json`'s `defaultThreadEnvMode` and `defaultWorktreeBaseRef`. Explicit dependency
branches and side-chat workspace inheritance remain available. Preserve base
selection in web `useHandleNewThread.ts` and mobile
`new-task-context-presentation.ts`, including native pending-draft presentation.
Feature readiness, frozen dependency-ordered release inputs and cleanup guards
live in `scripts/personal-fork/workflow.py`; all-host build/cutover stays in
`manage.py`. Shared readiness tags allow cross-clone discovery. Never restore
per-feature automatic publication or scheduled daily releases.
Verify with:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/personal-fork -p 'test_*.py'
vp test run packages/shared/src/t3ProjectFile.test.ts apps/web/src/hooks/useHandleNewThread.test.ts apps/mobile/src/features/threads/new-task-context-presentation.test.ts apps/mobile/src/state/pending-new-tasks-model.test.ts
```

Embedded side chats share their host panel's F6 stop and per-tab focus history.
Their conversation and composer remain labelled regions, without registering
duplicate workspace areas. This lets the existing panel focus rules select the
input on first open and restore the last used control when returning, while
preserving scroll position when an old message control has left view. Preserve
the `embedded` handling in `apps/web/src/components/ChatView.tsx` and the region
props in `apps/web/src/lib/workspaceFocus.ts` when upstream changes panel focus.
Verify opening/reopening, bidirectional F6 navigation and isolated focus history with
`vp test run apps/web/src/lib/workspaceFocus.browser.test.ts`.

Side chats inherit their parent's permission mode when created, including their
first turn, so starting a side conversation preserves the access already chosen
for that work. The side chat's mode can then be changed independently. Keep this
behavior in `ThreadForkService.ts`, `ProviderTurnStartService.ts`, and the web
`useSideChat.ts` hook; do not restore the upstream supervised overrides.

Verify with:

```sh
vp test run apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/ThreadFork.execution.test.ts apps/server/src/orchestration-v2/ProviderTurnStartService.test.ts -t 'side chat'
```

Sidebar profiles are an opt-in Labs feature that scopes the boring sidebar by
physical `(environmentId, projectId)` membership before repository grouping.
Project assignments override environment defaults, with a permanent General
fallback. Keep client-local profile persistence separate from ordinary settings
snapshots: desktop uses `DesktopSidebarProfiles` and IPC, web uses transactional
IndexedDB, and mobile uses serialized preference transforms. Switching retains
drafts and running work; disabling retains assignments. Preserve filtering in
sidebar groups, search, new-thread defaults, and native project selection, and
preserve profile intent across asynchronous project creation and pairing.
Both index drafts and server-welcome bootstrap navigation wait for profile and
client settings hydration. Profiles suppress bootstrap navigation, so reload
cannot replace a saved context.
Configurable `profile.next` and `profile.previous` shortcuts reuse profile
navigation and wrap in saved order, including All profiles after the last profile. Keep them available in
Keybindings settings without assigning default keys; they are inactive in dialogs
and settings and when profiles are disabled.
Keep `SidebarProfileNavigation.tsx` handlers and the desktop Browser forwarding
list in `ReopenClosedViewShortcut.tsx` connected to the same profile actions.

Owning modules are `packages/client-runtime/src/sidebarProfiles.ts`, web
`sidebarProfiles.ts` and `SidebarProfiles.tsx`, desktop
`settings/DesktopSidebarProfiles.ts`, and mobile `state/sidebar-profiles.ts`.
Verify precedence, reversible moves, concurrent durable writes, and UI scoping:

```sh
vp test run packages/client-runtime/src/sidebarProfiles.test.ts apps/desktop/src/settings/DesktopSidebarProfiles.test.ts apps/web/src/sidebarProfilesStorage.browser.test.ts apps/web/src/components/SidebarProfiles.browser.test.tsx apps/mobile/src/state/sidebar-profiles.test.tsx apps/web/src/components/SidebarProfiles.startup.browser.test.tsx
```

The boring sidebar reuses the Working-section setting to fold independent work
inside each project, rather than disabling Working. Keep the existing inbox
classification and return ordering, selected-thread visibility, and project
status summaries. Expansion is client-local per profile and repository group;
profile membership is still applied before grouping. Preserve V2's global shelf,
pinned/snoozed/settled placement, and mobile's existing layout. Owning paths are
`Sidebar.tsx`, `Sidebar.logic.ts`, `sidebar/SidebarProjectWorkingHeader.tsx`, and
`lib/sidebarTree.ts` (nested focus recovery). Verify folding, current-thread
visibility, actionable returns, and keyboard fallback with:

```sh
vp test run apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.logic.test.ts apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.browser.test.tsx apps/web/src/lib/sidebarTree.browser.test.ts
```

An empty chat composer sends the latest queued human message with Mod+Enter,
using the existing Send now command and eligibility rules. Pending optimistic
messages wait for their exact server acknowledgement; navigation, removal, or a
changed active turn cancels that pending shortcut. Preserve the editor-local
routing in `composer-logic.ts`, `chat/composerCommandKey.ts`, `ChatComposer.tsx`
and `ChatView.tsx`, and the selection/acknowledgement handling in
`chat/QueuedRunsControl.tsx`. Keep nonempty submissions and the existing
Mod+Shift+Enter first-queued-message shortcut unchanged. Holding Mod in an empty
composer with queued messages shows the send arrow in place of Stop; releasing
it restores Stop. Preserve this feedback in `ComposerPrimaryActions.tsx` and its
callback wiring through `ComposerFooterControls.tsx`. Web, desktop, and
embedded side chats share this path; native mobile keeps its existing controls.
Verify with:

```sh
vp test run apps/web/src/composer-logic.test.ts apps/web/src/components/chat/QueuedRunsControl.browser.test.tsx
```

Project headers in the boring sidebar show a thin composition ring and the total
of their section's chats whether expanded or collapsed, including folded Working
members and the current chat. Preserve the exclusive status counts (attention,
failure, unread completion, working, then read/idle), server-first visit watermarks,
and exact accessible/tooltip breakdown. Rounded segments start clockwise from the
top with small gaps; tiny shares retain their extent without overlapping caps.
Keep the summary visible when the new-chat action replaces the chevron on hover.
Owning paths are `Sidebar.logic.ts`, `Sidebar.tsx`,
`sidebar/SidebarProjectFolderHeader.tsx`, and `sidebar/SidebarProjectStatus.tsx`.
Verify transitions, exclusive counts, and stable totals through project folding:

```sh
cd apps/web && vp test run src/components/Sidebar.logic.test.ts src/components/Sidebar.browser.test.tsx
```

Chats waiting on the user use the warning palette for input, approval, and guest
requests, matching the project ring's attention segment. Preserve semantic warning
tokens in web `Sidebar.logic.ts` and `sidebar/SidebarThreadRow.tsx`, mobile
`thread-list-v2-items.tsx` and `ThreadSideChatsRow.tsx`, and the shared approval/input
tint in `widgets/AgentActivity.tsx`. Guest identity colors remain separate from
pending request status. Verify with `vp run check:changed` and light/dark client
captures of an input request beside its project summary; this is a visual change.

Idle sessions offer an AI-generated next prompt focused on continuing and finishing
the user's existing task. Web/desktop and embedded side chats accept it with plain
Tab into an empty draft; sending still uses the existing shortcut. Mobile taps to
insert. Escape/dismiss and normal drafting leave the user in control. Pending
permissions, questions, plans, running work and queued edits keep their existing
controls. Generation uses the environment/project text-generation model, an isolated
working directory and bounded conversation context. A per-turn server cache shares
concurrent requests; shell checks before/after generation discard stale responses.
There is no persistence migration or automatic message/approval submission.

Owning paths are server `textGeneration/PromptSuggestions.ts`, provider-core
`textGenerationPrompts.ts`/`textGenerationOperations.ts`, the prompt-suggestion RPC
contract/permission mapping, web `chat/usePromptSuggestion.ts`/`ChatComposer.tsx`,
and mobile `state/use-prompt-suggestion.ts`/`ThreadComposer.tsx`. Preserve the
new operation in provider wrappers; providers without application text generation
remain unsupported. Old servers simply leave suggestions absent for newer clients.
MCP and scheduled work can use the service, but do not generate unsolicited turns.
Verify context, shared generation, stale/pending suppression and destination grants:

```sh
vp test run apps/server/src/textGeneration/PromptSuggestions.test.ts packages/client-runtime/src/state/commandPermissions.test.ts
cd evals && vp run prompt-suggestions --model <model> --out /tmp/suggestion-eval
```

The fork also maintains project-local skills and coordinated deployment tooling
under `scripts/personal-fork/`.

Record each customization here with its intended behavior, owning paths, and a
focused verification command. Record intentional removals too, so an update
cannot silently restore them.

## Maintenance and installation

Read [the operations guide](docs/operations/personal-fork.md) for explicit batched releases, daily upstream
integration, weekly decisions and all-host deployment. `.t3-fork/` is ignored
installation-local configuration and runtime state, not product source.
The old Ubuntu sync timer is superseded; `scripts/personal-sync.sh` is a guard
that refuses to run the obsolete nested-agent workflow.

The maintenance tooling and four fork skills originate from
[ralfboltshauser/t3code](https://github.com/ralfboltshauser/t3code/tree/32f97584a7262856e18b7b0de4de49525bd88ece),
adapted for `dev`, Kreditanstalt and worker1337. The remote SSH runner honors
`~/.t3/fork-runner` so maintenance owns its runtime and reconnects cannot select
an official archive. A missing configured executable fails closed. Its regression
check is `vp test run packages/ssh/src/tunnel.test.ts`. Deployment fixtures run
with `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/personal-fork -p 'test_*.py'`.
